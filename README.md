# Simple-Python-Michaelis-Menten-Kinetics-Simulation-and-Fitting
This is a simple script to simulate and fit Michaelis-Menten kinetics as my research group learns Python and kinetics.

It needs some polish, especially adding error bars on double reciprocal plot and extending it to the x-intercept. Maybe also add labels on the plots later?
